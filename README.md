# Fake-Logo-detection
This project, developed by a team of 3 members, uses CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to detect fake logos. It processes a dataset of logos, trains a CNN model with 80% images, and tests with 20%. The model achieves 94% accuracy, providing classification results and a confusion matrix for evaluation.
